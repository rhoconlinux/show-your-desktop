Description
-----------

This is a simple app that once executed counts 5 seconds and take a screenshot. Without asking anything, it uploads automatically your shot to Imgur and when finish it copy the link of the URL in your clipboard. If you have the dock plank installed, it will add a launcher there too. Share your desktop in one move :)



How to install it
=================

Just  open a terminal and run this line. **IT IS ONE LINE**, so copy and paste carfully. You will be asked for sudo permissions to copy the downloaded files in /usr/bin/ and for install the dependencies.

**Ninja-Install** (Copy and paste):

sudo apt-get install xsel scrot xclip unzip -y && mkdir -p ~/.show-your-desktop-installer && cd ~/.show-your-desktop-installer && wget https://github.com/rhoconlinux/show-your-desktop/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip && rm master.zip && cd show-your-desktop-master/ && chmod +x install.sh && echo "installing..." && sh install.sh && cd ~

Details
-------

This small script is based on this work: https://gist.github.com/kynan/2941720
I've just added a script to make the installation and use super simple. In one command. :)
The main stuff is based on this thread http://askubuntu.com/questions/146888/software-for-imgur-image-upload, with the proper fixes I comment. I also modified the orifinal "shoot" script to wait and take the shot automatically (instead of requiring you to select a part of your screen to capture). This is an alpha release.
